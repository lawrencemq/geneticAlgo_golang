# geneticAlgo_golang - Searching for solutions using Genetic Algorithms

Here we look at several ways Genetic Algorithms can be used to search large solution spaces efficiently.

Included so far are:

* Finding the minimum for a quadradic in 2D space
* Finding the minimum for a quadradic in 3D space
* Finding high-performing lineups for FanDuel competitions (see fanduelGA.go)

## Executing

```
go build
./geneticAlgo_golan
```

## Updates

2022-05-03: Migrating to Go 1.18 and using generics. Fun times!
