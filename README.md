# geneticAlgo_golang - Searching for solutions using Genetic Algorithms

Here we look at several ways Genetic Algorithms can be used to search large solution spaces efficiently.

Included so far are:

* Finding high-performing lineups for FanDuel competitions (see fanduelGA.go)

## Executing

```
go build
./geneticAlgo_golan
```
